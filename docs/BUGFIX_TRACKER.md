# NikoLearn — Bug + Systemic Fix Tracker (live, owner-tracked)
**Updated 2026-07-01.** SSOT for every owner-reported bug + the systemic class behind it. New owner
reports get inserted here in priority order; nothing is asked until the list reaches the bottom.

## GOAL
Every reported bug fixed at the **choke-point** (shared layer, whole class dies), verified before it
reaches the owner. LOOP: weakest/highest-value open item → fix at choke-point → verify (logic+§6c render)
→ deploy (fix) → tick. DONE = root found · shared-layer fix · verified · live.

## ✅ LIVE (deployed + verified today)
- [x] pattern/reasoning owl speaks Georgian + right lesson/label — v1.298
- [x] iOS keyboard on every tap (registration) — v1.299
- [x] „Русский" dead option removed — v1.299
- [x] teaching beat on the FIRST wrong answer (grasp before retry, shared reQueueWrong) — v1.300
- [x] duplicate question in a round (deduped word/phrase pools) — v1.301
- [x] owl SPEAKS in math (fixed voiceable `say` phrases + clips) — v1.302
- [x] units/tens hint now DEFINES the terms inline (no assumed knowledge) — v1.302
- [x] READABILITY STANDARD (structured tutor text: lead+bullets+conclusion, adaptive font, measure) — v1.303
      + `docs/READABILITY_STANDARD.md`; units/tens hint restructured to match owner mockup.
- [x] adaptive fonts fanned out to ALL cards (question/sub/teach card/equation/count) — v1.304
- [x] owl speaks ka in ALL subjects (INV-3 fan-out complete: vocab/alpha/kings/count/compare/…) — v1.305
- [x] fast-reveal modes (spell/listen-yle/yesno/story) now teach-gate, no fast auto-advance — v1.306
- [x] privacy/consent copy OVER-STATED (owner 07-02): removed Clarity + inert Meta Pixel + cookie banner →
      site 100% cookieless (kept cookieless CF beacon + first-party aggregate Worker); privacy.html ka+en
      rewritten to no-ads reality; "სრული privacy"→"სრული კონფიდენციალურობა"; softened "GDPR & KIDS" — v1.307.
      Live-verified: banner gone, fbq/clarity never load, 0 errors, layout intact.
- [x] post-test recommendation was tiny (.88rem) + buried "which topic" (owner 07-02): placement results now a
      readable `.reco` card — prominent adaptive topic (clamp 1.28-1.7rem), readable lead/sub, + listen button
      (reco_start.mp3, edge-tts ka; playClip-gated) — v1.308. Live-verified: topic 27px, mp3 HTTP 200.
- [x] readability STRUCTURE fan-out beyond units/tens (owner 07-02): 4 inline-list hints → .r-lead + .r-item
      bullets (compare >/</=, shapes, clock hands, EN subject-verb) — v1.309. speakHint strips tags, csay clip
      covers voice (§6-safe). Live-verified: r-item=13, rendered as bullets, 0 errors.
- [x] INV-5 puzzle/riddle objects too small on phone (owner 07-02): pattern/math-pat numbers + rebus/model
      strand text + triangle (fluid box + %-positioned labels + clamp fonts) all clamp-fluid & BIGGER on phone
      — v1.310. Verified @390px: pattern 30→35px, rebus 24→26px, triangle val 15→18px, box 90→117px, aligned.
- [x] INV-3 owl-voice fan-out COMPLETE: listen-yle/yesno/speak/story returned from Tutor.build with no r.say
      (owl silent, TTS-fails on iOS) → added fixed ka say phrases + edge-tts clips (yle/yesno/speak/story_say.mp3)
      — v1.311. Live-verified: manifest ok, 4/4 mp3 HTTP 200, playClip true.
- [x] INV-6 talk grammar + audio drift (owner): built a diff-tool (talk.js q vs manifest key) → found 5 orphans
      (text fixed in talk.js, audio/key stale). Synced 4 prose cards to talk.js SSOT + regen clips: tlk_000
      (plural agreement ყოფილიყო→ყოფილიყვნენ), tlk_018 (უყენებდე→უწესებდე), tlk_025 (tense), tlk_026 (reworded)
      — v1.312. Verified: q→clip resolves, 4/4 mp3 200, old keys gone. tlk_045 poem left (edge). Gemini: NOT RUN (no key).
- [x] INV-1 teach-before-test (owner 07-02): multiplication primer before the first mul round (per profile,
      flag mulPrimerSeen) — teaches × = repeated addition with a visual (3 groups of 4 apples = 12) + owl clip.
      Tap „დავიწყოთ" → real round. — v1.313. Verified @390px: primer renders, listen, start-flow sets flag, 2nd skips.
- [x] INV-4 adaptive ladder for flat modes (owner 07-02): shared flatTier(mode) 1-3 climbs on a 4-correct
      mastery streak; bumpFlat in each handler. compare 10→20→100, skip ×5→×10→×2/3/4, clock +half hours at t2,
      money 2→4 items+more lari — v1.314. Verified: tier climbs+caps, wrong resets, generation scales, renders clean.
      (count/shapes left un-tiered: young foundational / small fixed pool = little headroom.)
- [x] #1 English one-tap „დაიწყე აქედან" (owner GO 07-02 after preview): results primary button launches the
      recommended session in ONE tap (startHereGo; English milestone → vocab quiz), tappable topic chip, secondary
      „ყველა თემა" for free-roam — v1.315. Preview-reviewed on desktop, GO'd, live-verified: one-tap=yes, v1.315.

## Findings (verified, no code change needed)
- INV-2 answerOutcome resolver — ASSESSED, refactor NOT done (deliberate). Fresh audit of all wrong-answer
  handlers: behaviour is ALREADY consistent via 3 appropriate primitives — reQueueWrong (9 handlers),
  teachAndConfirm (listen-yle/yesno/story/spell), rule-reveal on 2nd miss (pattern/reason). exam = no-teach
  BY DESIGN (assessment), count = retry-till-right BY DESIGN (youngest mode). The original "15 handlers, only
  9 share the contract" framing was overstated. Forcing all into ONE monolithic answerOutcome is the WRONG
  abstraction — it would break exam (must not teach) and count (must retry). User-facing value = zero; regression
  risk across 15 modes = high. Correct architecture (small shared primitives, each handler picks the right one)
  already exists. Not shipping a risky invisible refactor for elegance. [If owner still wants the consolidation
  purely for maintainability, it's optional tech-debt, do it in isolation with a full per-mode test pass.]
- "correct answer marks too fast": on the CURRENT live build a wrong math answer no longer flash-marks the
  correct one (verified via a timed DOM timeline) — it teaches (hint 1st miss, gated teach card 2nd miss).
  This was the OLD behaviour before v1.300/v1.302. Re-test on v1.303; if it persists, name the exact mode.

## 🔬 DEEP AUDIT 2026-07-02 (8-dimension Quality-Audit standard, 40-agent team, method-upgraded per-mode matrix + play-on-phone)
Ship gate FAILED — every dimension <8 (brutal bar). Scores weakest-first: **D8 improvement=3 · D7 owl=4 · D3 comprehension=5 · D4 pedagogy=5 · D6 voice=5 · D1 content=6 · D2 visual=6 · D5 human/trust=7.** 48 confirmed findings (1 CRIT, 1 HIGH, 28 MED, 18 LOW). Full result: tasks/w51l1kdx2.output.
Two buckets: (A) shippable BUGS → fixed below; (B) PROGRAM/INVESTMENT gaps (no A/B framework, no native-voice talent, no CEFR/Common-Core tagging, no WCAG style guide) = roadmap forks needing owner decision, NOT loop-fixable.

## ⏳ STAGED — v1.316 (preview, awaiting owner GO → live)
- [~] 🔴 CRITICAL owl leaks the answer (D7 AITUTOR-01): tutor.js math count-on hints printed the terminal number
      (5−2 → "…უკან: 4, 3…"). CHOKE-POINT fix in tutor.js countSeq()/mulSeq(): enumeration always stops ≥1 step
      short of the total → verified 0 answer-reveals across 674 result-revealing combos. Guardrail restored.
- [~] 🟠 HIGH 18 versions never reached returning users (D8-F1): sw.js CACHE frozen at nikolearn-1.297 while app=1.315
      (cache-first SW never re-installed). FIX: ran bump.mjs (single-writer) → APP_VERSION + sw CACHE + landing footer
      all synced to 1.316; this deploy delivers the whole v1.298→1.316 backlog to returning/PWA users. QA gate PASSED.
      HARDENING DONE: installed `.git/hooks/pre-push` — any push to `main` now runs `npm test` and is BLOCKED if the
      gate fails (the gate already flags APP_VERSION↔CACHE↔footer drift as release-blocking); verified it fires on a
      main-ref push. The drift class can no longer ship silently. (Hook is local to this clone, not git-tracked.)

## ⏳ OPEN — priority order
(no open items)
2. [ ] **INV-4 adaptive ladder** for the flat modes (count/compare/skip/shapes/money/clock). [reordered
       ahead of INV-2: visible value + lower risk; INV-2's user-facing behaviour already shipped via down-payments].
3. [x] **INV-2 answerOutcome resolver** — ASSESSED (see Findings): behaviour already consistent via 3 correct
       primitives; monolithic contract = wrong abstraction (would break exam/count). No refactor shipped (senior call).

Legend: `[ ]` open · `[~]` partial · `[x]` DONE + live.
Architecture SSOT: `docs/INTERACTION_CONTRACT.md`. Branch note: hotfixes linear on main; F2 feature branch
(jelly cards, vivid counting, landing telemetry) to be rebased onto main before its own ship.
