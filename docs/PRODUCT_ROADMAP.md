# NikoLearn — Product Roadmap (PO SSOT)
**Status:** CANONICAL · **Updated:** 2026-07-23 (s28 — **TWO-TRACK RELEASE MODEL now policy** (owner-set, Amendment f): TRACK A HOTFIX = bug/UX/a11y/perf fixes ship autonomously straight to live (verification system is the gate, no owner GO); TRACK B DROP = net-new feature/content builds on a `drop/<name>` branch → owner previews the FINISHED testable thing → GO → publish → Georgian FB/blog „what's new" seed. First HOTFIX proof: **NB-96/97/98 learn-nav SHIPPED LIVE v1.373 (`928f407`)** autonomously, §6c live-verified. **IN FLIGHT (DROP):** 66 „ენის გასატეხი" alliteration sentences (33×2, original IP) → Gemini KA-QA → HTML preview → owner GO. **PI-112** memory-keeper idea recovered (was an intake miss). Prior s27 — W7 day-question SHIPPED LIVE v1.369; MC-2 content authored + Gemini-passed, MC-6 designed, both pending owner validation; AF-1/AF-2 agent follow-ups logged. Prior s26 — owner W-batch verdicts: W7 v3 APPROVED, W3 hero APPROVED (Template#2/frame6), W1/W2 not-approved + discoverability gap, W4 readability standard, Bubu-repeat B re-OK; NB-89 voice + NB-90 reports-scatter + PI-104 voice-gate logged) · **Owner of this file:** the PO/CKO agent, every session

## The two rules (owner-set 2026-07-15)

**1. ჩანაცვლება ≠ წაშლა. Superseded means new + old TOGETHER.**
Nothing is ever deleted. A superseded plan keeps its text and gains a header saying which facts died and
why (see `V2-ACTION-PLAN.md`). Cold docs move to `docs/archive/YYYY-MM/` git-tracked; they never disappear.
An audit folded into the NB ledger is MIRRORED, not replaced: `05_auditbyagents/bycodex_Next_Steps.md`
still holds the full v2.00 audit, the ledger just makes its findings trackable.

**2. Nothing falls out silently.** Any task dropped, deferred, parked, or judged not-worth-logging gets a
row in §DROPPED with a reason, a date, and a revive trigger. „We decided not to" is a decision worth
keeping; „it quietly vanished" is a defect. This section is never pruned — only appended and re-dated.

## ▶ NOW (feature wave, s25 — owner order 2026-07-18 = GI-34)

| # | Item | Why it is first | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | ~~Merge branch → live push~~ | ~~Value the kid cannot feel until it ships.~~ | ✅ **DONE 2026-07-20: v1.366 live** (owner GO = GI-33; NB-53/32/30/57 shipped + live-verified) |
| W1 | PI-95 visible level ladder — PROTOTYPE + show | Owner's own idea; the wave's anchor. | **SHOWN 2026-07-20** — interactive mock in `output/2026-07-20-ფიჩერ პროტოტიპები W1 W2 W4 by Niko.html` (§6c verified: render + tap-interaction + screenshots) · **UPDATE 2026-07-22: NOT approved — owner „not so good, could be better" AND cannot see WHERE/WHEN it appears. Owed: (1) design → PI-98/PI-99 standard, (2) make the surfacing point visible/explained. Gated behind W7-v3 ship (v3 is the approved visual bar to lift W1 to).** |
| W2 | PI-96 pride-share card — PROTOTYPE + show | Owner's own idea. | **SHOWN 2026-07-20** — same file as W1; initial-only default, parent-space share, no direct posting · **UPDATE 2026-07-22: NOT approved — owner „design not ideal, uncertain" AND cannot see WHERE/WHEN it appears. Same two-part fix as W1 (design to standard + visible surfacing point).** |
| W3 | PI-97 owl video-tales — pilot | Owner's own idea (FB market signal 471K views). | **TEMPLATE PICKED 2026-07-21: owner chose template 2 „რატომ, ბუბუ?"** (confirms the rec). 3-templates compare HTML now superseded → removed from output/, backup `backups/output-deleted-2026-07-21/`. **HERO REJECTED 2026-07-21** — owner: „W3 hero კადრი გახსნა ხარისხის აშკარად არ არის" (reversed his earlier praise; PI-102). Pilot (hero+7-scene animatic, `output/2026-07-20-W3 ვიდეო-ანიმატიკი რატომ ბუბუ by Niko.html`) BEING REWORKED to a real quality bar (PI-98/PI-99), open fork = AI-cartoon tier vs hand-vector. **AUDIO = decision #4 (open):** 7 new ka lines not in AUDIO_MANIFEST; default = no spend, keep silent captioned animatic. **CLARIFIED 2026-07-21 (owner follow-up, [[show-finished-product-not-spec]]):** owner „ვერ გავიგე შინაარსი … საბოლო დასრულებული პროდუქტი და არა ნახევარფაბრიკატი" — the 3-templates spec-table failed to convey content and the recommendation; he judges video by a FINISHED watchable pilot, not a spec/animatic. Go-forward = build ONE finished „რატომ ბუბუ" pilot, NOT another table. The gating fork he must decide = SMALL bounded spend for finished quality (AI-generated illustration for ~5 scenes + one ka voice track) vs free hand-SVG (= the level he already rejected). Recommendation: authorize a one-episode pilot budget; default if silent = hold the video-tale line (do NOT ship another free animatic), keep moving on free in-app work. **UPDATE 2026-07-22 — HERO APPROVED (visual): owner accepts the rebuilt opening = Template #2 „რატომ, ბუბუ?" · frame 6 (learning payoff) · kid-visual-standard v1.2 · mascot = canonical logo-Bubu (NB-84 lock honoured). Reverses the 07-21 hero rejection on the VISUAL axis (PI-102 → RESOLVED). Standing bar (PI-101): the FULL video must HOLD this quality to the end in BOTH visual AND audio. Remaining open on W3 = AUDIO only = money/§13.3 gate #4; default = silent captioned animatic until owner GO on paid voice (see NB-89 — any EN/KA voice must also pass the PI-104 voice-identity gate).** |
| W4 | Weekly parent card — PROTOTYPE + show | Feature 4 of the accepted list. | **SHOWN 2026-07-20** — same file as W1; all-local stats, feeds W2 card; W5 strengthens its letter data · **UPDATE 2026-07-22: MORE acceptable (owner's most-approved of the batch) — one required change before ship: apply the text-readability standard so a parent grasps it in human Georgian, main points as BULLETS (no dense prose). Then ship.** · **DONE 2026-07-22 → iterated to v4 on owner feedback:** current preview `output/2026-07-22-W4 კვირის ბარათი მშობელს v4 by Niko.html` (§6c-verified render). v3 applied owner's 4 pts (warm BLUF one-liner · OLD KPI cards + emoji icons · 📅 „5-ჯერ / ბოლო 7 დღეში" · Bubu = the recommendation). **v4** applied next feedback: KPI icon+number side-by-side (გვერდიგვერდ) · „🦉 ბუს რჩევა" heading then advice directly, „ამ კვირის სამუშაო" label dropped · **all copy through the §6f Gemini KA-gate** („დააქეთე"=non-word→„წაახალისე", KPI2 „ასოზე ივარჯიშა" grammar, +2 calques fixed). Superseded versions kept in `backups/output-deleted-2026-07-22/` (ჩანაცვლება≠წაშლა). **APPROVED by owner 2026-07-22 („v4 გიდასტურებ").** Next build: app-integration in `parent.js`, bundled into a future ship (mockup approved, no live push yet). |
| W5 | Per-letter progress — BUILD | Feature 5; also unlocks audit-B E1 measurability. | ✅ **SHIPPED LIVE v1.367 2026-07-21** (owner GO in the "4 decisions" msg; release `5818550`→origin/main; Pages deploy run 29779900452 success; §6c live-verified nikolearn.com footer=v1.367, 0 console errors). Was `a2807d3` — weak-first rounds + parent mastery grid + weakest-3 tip; deploy-guard all 6 behavioral harnesses green. |
| W6 | Adaptive difficulty — BUILD | Feature 6. | ✅ **SHIPPED LIVE v1.367 2026-07-21** same release — rolling-window step-DOWN for math dead-zone + flat tiers (first ever), climb rules untouched, silent for the child. |
| W7 | Daily curious question — ≥5 versions + show | Feature 7 (owner: „5 ვერსია მინიმუმ"). | **SHOWN 2026-07-20** — `output/2026-07-20-დღის კითხვა 6 ვერსია by Niko.html` (6 original Q&A versions). **REDESIGNED 2026-07-20 (v2, owner „ვიზუალურად ცოდა უფრო ეფექტურას მოველოდი")** — `output/2026-07-20-დღის კითხვა 6 ვერსია v2 by Niko.html`: 6 bespoke per-question SVGs, one palette, kid-visual-standard v1.1, §6c-verified. Awaits owner design-level nod (gates W1 redesign). Skills: kid-visual-standard v1.1 · build-provenance. Gates: §6c ✓. **UPDATE 2026-07-22 — v3 APPROVED: owner „v3 is better than all previous, not fully ideal, room for improvement". Favourite = „რატომ არ ვარდება მთვარე დედამიწაზე?" (visual expresses content well + motion effective). → v3 = SHIP candidate to production; „room for improvement" carries into the next visual pass, does NOT block the ship. Shipping v3 unblocks W1/W2/W4 (it is the approved visual bar they must be lifted to). **DECOUPLED 2026-07-22 (Step-0 catch): v3 exists ONLY as prototype HTML (`output/2026-07-20-დღის კითხვა 6 ვერსია v3 by Niko.html`), never integrated into the app — v1.368 shipped NB-72..75 ALONE; W7 remaining work = build v3 INTO the app (screen + 6 Qs + nav wiring) → v1.369, next in build queue. Owner favourite Q = „რატომ არ ვარდება მთვარე დედამიწაზე?".** **✅ SHIPPED LIVE v1.369 2026-07-22 (`60ee370`; owner GO „ship it"): dayq module + young-home world card (voiced wclip_20) + all-home §14 sweep. §6c live-verified nikolearn.com — card renders on young home → opens scene+question+Bubu, footer v1.369, 0 console errors. Two agent-discovered follow-ups logged below (volume gap + home-card-registry consolidation).** |
| W8 | Voice Talks deepening — PLAN + B prototype | Feature 8 (owner: „ძალიან მინდა"; „გააკეთე B ვერსია შენი რეკომენდაცია"). | **SHOWN 2026-07-20** (plan): `output/2026-07-20-ხმოვანი საუბრები გეგმა by Niko.html` (3-path privacy comparison; REC = on-device path B). **BUILT 2026-07-20 (B prototype):** `output/2026-07-20-გაიმეორე ბუბუსთან W8-B პროტოტიპი by Niko.html` — functional tap-to-talk „repeat after ბუბუ" loop, mic on-device (nothing sent by us), swappable `recognize()` seam (browser engine now / whisper-WASM path B drops in), 6 bespoke SVGs, en-US TTS for English word, 2-tries-then-encourage. Skills: kid-visual-standard v1.1 · build-provenance. Gates: §6c ✓ · red-team (mic-deny / no-speech / never-punish) ✓ · Gemini pending pre-package. **PATH B CONFIRMED 2026-07-21** — owner: „გზა B (on-device), პირობას „ყველაფერი მოწყობილობაზე" არ არღვევს" (accepts B prototype + on-device direction; W8-B ACCEPTED). The plan-compare HTML now superseded → removed from output/, backup `backups/output-deleted-2026-07-21/`. **Still open = decision #3:** TRUE private path B (whisper-WASM) needs owner GO for the ~40MB on-device model dep (§15b); default = hold, ship browser-engine seam meanwhile. **UPDATE 2026-07-22: Bubu-repeat B re-confirmed OK by owner. BUT the English word voice (heard on the „1 apple" card) reads as a DIFFERENT voice from the app's embedded one (tempo/clarity/tonality) = NB-89 → must pass the PI-104 voice-identity gate before this ships. Apple VISUAL accepted.** |
| — | Features 9-10 (progress export, diaspora mode) | — | NOT NOW (owner: „დროებით არა" — DROPPED row below) |

**Agent-discovered follow-ups (W7 v1.369 build, 2026-07-22 — roadmap, not PI ledger; these are agent finds, not owner input):**
- **AF-1 (W7 volume gap, MEDIUM):** the „დღის კითხვა" ships with 6 questions → a „daily" question actually repeats every 6 days. A truly-daily hook needs ~30+ original questions (§11) so a child rarely sees a repeat within a month. Not a blocker (6 is a valid v1), but the „daily" promise is only half-true until the bank grows. Revive trigger: next W7 content pass / when day-question retention is measured. Related visual-volume standard: PI-98.
- **AF-2 (home-card-registry consolidation, MEDIUM, §14 architecture):** adding ONE home world card (dayq) required edits in 4 places — worlds.js (TWO age arrays), audio-manifest.js, qa/_worlds.mjs count, tools/_gen_worlds.py. That is the exact §14 duplication class: home cards live in parallel hardcoded arrays, not one registry. Root-cause fix = a single `HOME_CARDS` config (per age band) that worldsHome() maps over + the QA count derives from, so a new card is a one-line add and can't desync. Revive trigger: next time a home card is added, or the MC-2/MC-6 world entries land (they will each add cards). Consolidate then rather than duplicating again.
- **AF-3 (Georgian-native QA gate over ALL content = P0, HIGH → owner-elevated 2026-07-22 via NB-91):** the §6f Gemini native-Georgian gate runs per-NEW-batch only; the whole live corpus (1336 sentence-like KA strings, scanned this session) has never had a systematic native pass. Proof it matters: „გვეთქმევა ნერწყვი" + „ისვრის ხე ფოთლებს" shipped LIVE in dayq (v1.369) because that content bypassed §6f entirely (visual approval only) — owner caught both, asked „ამან გემინის ტესტი არ გაიარა?". Root-cause fix (class, not the 3 copies): a Georgian-native quality GATE that runs over all content (gemini pass + owner final eye on flagged strings), ideally wired like `npm test`/visual-gate so bad Georgian can't ship. This is ALSO the Software-3.0 autonomy lever — an automated content-quality gate is what lets content ship without the owner eyeballing every string. **PO verdict (my roadmap version, `output/2026-07-22-ნიკოს როუდმეპი ჩემი ვერსია by Niko.html`): this is not a mid-list line item, it is the trust FOUNDATION → #1. The corpus-wide non-native count is currently UNMEASURED; measuring it is step 1 of the gate.** Related: NEXT-previous #2 Georgian-quality class (NB-13), NB-90 trust. Revive/act trigger: next content session — build the gate before authoring more content.

Wave rules: "ai pulsar georgia" GitHub resources checked first (owner instruction); prototypes are SHOWN, not shipped — any live push needs a new GO; NB-65/PI-89 stop-order still freezes colour/text rewrites.
**Scout result (2026-07-20):** owner's reference = **AI Pulse Georgia** → `github.com/tornikebolokadze1-cyber/awesome-ai-pulse-georgia` (300 AI dev tools, Georgian descriptions, CC0, 125★) [FACT]. No kids-content / Georgian-TTS / adaptive-learning assets in it. Two usable leads: (1) media-generation category = candidate build-time pipeline for W3 video-tales + story illustrations (ComfyUI, Diffusers, HunyuanVideo; licenses per-tool, check before use); (2) `whisper.cpp` explicitly supports Georgian ASR on-device [FACT] — future "child answers by voice" option for W8, zero-backend compatible. Georgian quality of open TTS models (Coqui/Bark/VoxCPM) = [TO VALIDATE]. Ruled out: Pulsar AI/Supernova (acquired startup), `aipulsar` (crypto) — wrong entities.

## ▶ NOW-previous (s21 classes — still committed, next dev slot after the wave)

| # | Item | Why it is first | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Promise-integrity class** (NB-27 feedback-row TTL vs the ≤12mo privacy promise) | The app makes a promise the system does not keep. Same class as NB-25 (false privacy claim, shipped 07-12) and the privacy card fixed today. This class, not the individual bugs, is what a parent and Google Play both judge. | NEXT UP |
| 2 | **Georgian-quality class** (NB-13 `ვკრებავთ`→`ვკრებთ`, NB-9 untranslated chrome, NB-2 tutor wording) | Being genuinely Georgian IS the differentiation. A grammar error in the tutor is not a "MED bug", it is the product failing its core claim in front of the parent whose trust decides retention. | NB-13 awaits owner native validation; NB-9/NB-2 ready |
| 2b | **NB-72..75 audit fix wave** (4 DEFECTs from the 07-17 audit) | Verified defects sitting open. | ✅ **SHIPPED LIVE v1.368 2026-07-22** (`d293a02`; §6c live-verified nikolearn.com) |

## ▶ NEXT (committed, ordered)

| # | Item | Why | Trigger/blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | NB-26 owner secret in `?k=` → auth header | A real secret leaking into logs/history. Cheap fix, no child impact today, but it is the line between a hobby app and one a school can adopt. | Worker deploy = owner gate (§15b) |
| 5 | NB-30 boot half: `index.html:70` preventDefaults ALL unhandledrejection | Storage half closed today; boot/runtime errors still swallowed app-wide. | Classify benign-vs-bug rejections first |
| 6 | NB-1 footer/dock consolidation · NB-5 exam bonus cap→5 · NB-6 skip-tier monotonic | Mechanics/consistency. Real but nobody's trust turns on them. | Ready |
| 7 | Reading-ladder v0 (Georgian) | Biggest CONTENT gap + core differentiation (30-day plan item ⑦). **The owner named this the #1 strategic gap on 06-17 (PI-39)** — that framing was lost until the 07-15 sweep. | Owner segment call helps but does not block authoring |
| 8 | **PI-64 — the tutor must TEACH on a wrong answer** (explain the mistake → teach → encourage → only then reveal). Fold in PI-68 (reveal is too fast to perceive). | The owl's whole reason to exist, and the cheapest big win on the board: **the expensive half is already built and paid for.** `edges[].reason_ka` (the Georgian explanations) are authored in the data; `tutor.js` never reads them. The owner named this 07-01; the Marble audit found the identical hole independently (learning #5). Two paths, same gap, neither reached a plan until today. | Ready — no owner input needed |
| 9 | **PI-73 — analytics must separate WHO abandoned: parent (at signup) or child (in play)** | The 67% abandonment number is **unreadable without it**. FB traffic may never reach a child at all, in which case we are optimizing the wrong funnel. Blocks any honest read of activation. | Ready; touches the telemetry lane (PI-47) |
| 10 | **PI-84 — „დასვი კითხვა და ამოხსენი": the child poses the question, then solves it** (math). Situation given, no question attached; the child formulates it. | From Niko's real worksheet (07-15) — the owner liked it and named the gate himself: „სწორი ტუტორინგი უნდა". He is right, and it is the whole item. Every math mode we ship hands the child the question and grades a CHOICE; this one grades a FORMULATION, which our engine cannot do. That makes it the first item that genuinely needs the tutor to think, not to check. **Strategically it is also the one format a quiz app cannot copy** — it is the difference between practising arithmetic and practising mathematical thinking. | **Bound to #8** (PI-64 tutor-teaches). Do NOT start before it: shipping this on today's right/wrong engine gives the child a blank box and a red X, which is worse than not shipping. |

## ▶ MATH COURSE TRACK (PI-105, planned 2026-07-22 — NOT yet slotted, awaiting owner sequence call)

**Plan doc:** `output/2026-07-22-მათემატიკის გეგმა და Khan-იდან სწავლა by Niko.html`. **Frame:** Khan owns school-age→university STEM in Georgian (Educare Georgia); our whitespace = playful 2-8 + grades 1-4 national curriculum on the mastery engine we already run (`MATH_LV`/`flatTier`/`patTier`, W5/W6). Sequence: WEDGE (ages 2-10) now · GROWTH (grades 5-9) next · HORIZON (secondary→university) = learn from Khan, don't fight yet. **Builds on existing math-DAG work** (Marble #4, `content/graph/math-fractions.v0.json` 11-node ka ladder) and PI-59 (Khan partnership) — extend, don't duplicate. Origin: PI-100/PI-103/PI-105.

| MC | Drop | Band | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MC-1 | რიცხვი & არითმეტიკა 2-9 | WEDGE | EXTEND | engine exists (MATH_LV/flatTier); needs content volume + skill-map surfacing |
| MC-2 | ფორმების სამყარო (figures + classification, ეროვნ. μ24) | WEDGE | **CONTENT AUTHORED** | very visual; §11 original. **2026-07-22: content spec v2 authored (6 modes A-F, own SVG figures per PI-98, D3 subtlety deferred to bonus). Gemini §6f gate PASSED 9/10, 5 native corrections applied (არცერთი→არც ერთი · განსხვავდება→„არ ჰგავს სხვებს" · dropped ჩვეულებრივ · ციფერბლატი→საათი · გორავს→დაგორავს). Awaiting owner native validation → then BUILD (extend data.js SHAPES + modes B-F in games.js + svgFigure renderer). Spec: scratchpad mc2-forms-FINAL.md + owner HTML report.** |
| MC-3 | სარკის თამაში (axial symmetry) | WEDGE | NEW (reframed) | **NotebookLM pilot 2026-07-22 [FACT/TO VALIDATE]:** ღერძული სიმეტრია is officially grades V-VI (`მათ.დაწყ.(II).10`), NOT 1-4. So justify MC-3 as an abundance-lens early-readiness play (visual/fun, builds intuition before the formal V-VI unit), NOT as a 1-4 national mandate. Still strong first visual candidate; cross-check official text before committing copy. |
| MC-3b | პერიმეტრის მცველი (perimeter) | WEDGE | NEW candidate (pilot) | **NotebookLM pilot 2026-07-22 [FACT]:** perimeter (`მათ.დაწყ.(I).7`) IS a 1-4 ESG requirement Khan's early Georgian course lacks: real gap, high-priority original drop. |
| MC-4 | დრო & ფული (clock/calendar + lari) | WEDGE | NEW | everyday-life context |
| MC-5 | მონაცემები (pictogram/table/diagram) | WEDGE | NEW | grade-IV peak |
| MC-6 | უნარების რუკა / skill-map view | engine | **DESIGNED** | Khan's one real lesson we lack; reuse W5 grid pattern; ties to Marble #4 DAG. **2026-07-22: design v1 drafted. §14 root-cause move = EXTRACT parent.js:298 mastery/color logic into ONE shared `niko/mastery.js` (skillState/stateColor/SKILL_DAG/masteryOf), both parent grid + child map call it (no duplicate grid). SKILL_DAG = math course unlock order. Child-facing motivating map (owl-guided „next adventure"). §12 all criteria ≥8. OPEN owner fork = child-facing v1 (recommended default: that IS the gap) vs parent-only-first. Spec: scratchpad mc6-skillmap-DESIGN.md + owner HTML report.** |
| MC-7 | ფორმატის ფენა (Georgian-voiced clip + „რას ვისწავლით" card + quiz/test per skill) | format | PARTIAL | video-voice = FREE/best-standard (owner 2026-07-22) — no money gate |
| MC-8 | მასწავლებლის dashboard | Hybrid-C | PARKED | revive trigger: first pilot teacher (PI-94) |
| MC-9 | წილადები (fractions: halves/fourths → mixed + add/sub via a visual „butterfly/cross") | WEDGE→GROWTH | NEW candidate (**PI-109**, owner video ref 2026-07-23) | ESG `(I)` grade-3 „fraction basics" + grade-4 fluency; **extend the existing `content/graph/math-fractions.v0.json` 11-node ka ladder, don't duplicate.** Abundance/§11: learn the cross-multiply visual mechanic from the referenced reels, author OUR own numbers + animated NikoLearn figure + Georgian voice; wire into the mastery loop. Video-lesson delivery shares the W3 + §6 audio bar (PI-101/PI-104). |

**Research capability (2026-07-22) [FACT]:** the ESG↔Khan gap-mapping runs through the authenticated **NotebookLM CLI** (notebook `e5b882b9`, sources = our 4 md + official ESG PDF + 3 Khan pages). Consolidated report: `output/2026-07-22-NotebookLM math pilot (ფორმები და სიმეტრია) by Niko.html`. All 3 research passes are DONE. Codes below = source-asserted (the ESG PDF says so), not independently verified. See PI-106.

**GAP MAP (what ESG 1-4 requires that Khan's early Georgian course lacks):**
- **Arithmetic** `(I).2`: ESG wants all FOUR operations incl. multiplication/division intro by grade 3-4. Khan Early Math's first ~8 topics have NO mult/div = real content gap, not just volume. Sharpens **MC-1** from "EXTEND volume" to "EXTEND + add mult/div".
- **Shapes** `(I).7`: 2D/3D figures + classification. Khan covers this. Symmetry: see contradiction flag.
- **Perimeter** `(I).7`/`(I).8` (grade ~3): Khan early lacks it. Confirms **MC-3b „პერიმეტრის მცველი"**.
- **Time/money** `(I).3`: clock + calendar + lari. Khan covers analog clock but LACKS calendar (days/months) and its money is US-dollar based even when labeled "lari". **MC-4** is a genuine localization gap (authentic ლარი/თეთრი + calendar).
- **Data** `(I).10`: classify/collect/pictogram/bar/pie. Khan covers pictogram + bar but LACKS pie chart in the early course + interactive collection for pre-readers. **MC-5**.

**SCOPE & SEQUENCE (grade 1→4, [INFERENCE] from ESG + Khan):** 1: count to 100, +/- within 20, 2D shapes, clock (full/half hour), compare length. · 2: +/- to 100, place value, 3D shapes + classify, standard length, count lari/tetri, pictogram. · 3: +/- to 1000, intro mult/div, perimeter, calendar, fraction basics (halves/fourths), simple tables. · 4: four operations fluent, axial symmetry, bar + pie charts, mass/volume, find-the-unknown + word problems.

**COVERAGE → SHARPENED PRIORITIES (from the skill-graph pass):** **High** = MC-2 forms (none yet), MC-4 time/money (none + localization gap), MC-6 skill-map (Khan's one real mechanism we lack), MC-3b perimeter. · **Medium** = MC-5 data, fractions DAG runtime (JSON exists, not wired into the app). · **Low** = MC-1 arithmetic (engine exists; just add mult/div content).

**CONTRADICTION FLAG (CKO, [TO VALIDATE], UNRESOLVED):** NotebookLM placed axial symmetry differently across two grounded queries: strand-1 said officially grades V-VI (`მათ.დაწყ.(II).10`); the skill-graph pass placed it at grade 4 under `(I).9`/მუხ.24. The two answers disagree, so symmetry's exact grade is NOT settled. This does not block MC-3: build it as early visual readiness (abundance lens) for 5-8, which maps to whatever formal grade it lands in. Reconcile against the official ESG text before any grade claim in customer copy.

**INBOUND 2026-07-23 (PI-108, owner video ref — „easy drawing for kids"):** a GUIDED draw-along format = build a real picture FROM SIMPLE SHAPES (house/tent from triangles). Not a standalone MC drop; it BRIDGES **MC-2 „ფიგურების ქვეყანა"** (learn the shapes) → the existing **ხატვა/Drawing world (PI-4)** — a „დახატე ფიგურებით" mode. Slot as an MC-2 follow-on / ხატვა extension once MC-2 ships. Abundance/§11: learn the shape-decomposition method, author our own step sequences + objects.

**INBOUND 2026-07-23 (PI-111, owner loved kids.ge format — „ანბანთქარბა" + „ენის გასატეხი"):** per-letter alliterative sentences (nearly every word starts with the letter) as a fun repeat-line on the **ანბანი / letter-learn screen** (`alpha.js` learn path). NOT a new MC track — it extends an EXISTING surface (each letter already shows an example word; add its alliterative „ენის გასატეხი"). High-leverage, low-risk build candidate. Content gate: author our OWN original 33 sentences (§11), natural Georgian, no em dash (§8), each verified per §12 (alliteration holds · real words · age-fit · natural); voicing = recorded clips (§6, never runtime KA TTS). Ties to PI-110 (kids.ge source) + PI-14/19 (poems).

**Owner call needed (Lane B):** where to slot MC-1..MC-6 against the current NOW/NEXT (reading-ladder, tutor-teaches #8, day-question ship). Default if silent: **MC-2 (ფორმების სამყარო) + MC-6 (skill-map view)** are the two highest-leverage first drops: one new visual subject in our whitespace, one engine-level win that makes all accumulated mastery visible. Nothing here is committed to a slot yet; this is the plan, not a build order.

## ▶ RECOVERED INTAKE (2026-07-15) — placed, not lost

The full-corpus sweep recovered **49 ideas that existed nowhere on disk** (ledger was 32 → true total **81**,
i.e. it was 40% complete while calling itself the list). Root cause + the completeness rule: `REASONING-LESSONS.md` **L14**.
All 49 now carry a `PI-<n>` row in `PRODUCT_IDEAS.md`. The load-bearing ones are placed here so rule 2 holds:

| PI | Item | Placement |
|---|---|---|
| PI-64 · PI-68 | Tutor explains before revealing | **NEXT #8** (above) |
| PI-73 | Parent-vs-child abandonment split | **NEXT #9** (above) |
| PI-39 | Georgian reading-bridge = the #1 strategic gap (his words, 06-17) | folded into **NEXT #7** |
| **PI-77** | **FORK: during the MVP window, insight extraction outranks strict privacy** | **OWNER GATE — surfaced, never silently reconciled.** Direct tension with the standing §5 promise („all data on-device, privacy absolute"). An agent cannot settle this; it trades a stated parent promise against learning speed. Until he rules, §5 stands. |
| **PI-69** | 8-10yo have no value strong enough to return for — „დამაჩელენჯე" | **LATER, unanswered.** He asked to be challenged on a content-depth gap on 07-05 and got no answer. Needs a real analysis, not a row. Bound to the same segment call as Phase-1 activation. |
| PI-46 | His own red-team: „templatable platform" = venture narrative, „**აქ კვდება focus**" | LATER — a strategy fork (Lane B), alive alongside PI-11 (audience) |
| PI-45 | GTM target: 500 paying kids / $5,000+/mo / owner ≤1hr/day | LATER — the only quantified goal he ever set; nothing is currently measured against it |
| PI-48 | Red-Team + Pre-Mortem as a **standing periodic ritual** (he said „დაიმახსოვრე") | LATER — a process item; he asked for it to be remembered and it was not |
| PI-59 | Khan Academy partnership → Georgianize their free English content | LATER — biggest unexplored partnership; needs the deep analysis he asked for on 06-27 |
| PI-60 | Georgian voice-actor demo material + infrastructure | LATER — **he flagged this as lost himself on 06-27** („დაიკარგა თემა") and it stayed lost 18 days |
| PI-61 | Georgian letters in one real continuous stroke (full spec given 07-03) | LATER — **he had to re-tell it once already** (given 06-28, re-given 07-03) |
| PI-78 | Kill the theme picker, lock brand orange | LATER — pairs with PI-12 (brand lock, owner-gated) |
| PI-54 | FB/Instagram in-app browser = install trap → „open in Safari/Chrome" overlay | LATER — sharper than PI-30; PI-55 is the real-parent signal under it |
| PI-34 · PI-35 · PI-33 · PI-36 | BoG payments · GITA grant · launch promo · seasonal pricing | LATER — all money/strategy = owner lane |
| the remaining 33 | mechanics, content, process, research | tracked in the PI ledger; none is silently dropped |

## ▶ LATER

- Phase-1 activation (guided-guest first-win) — needs the owner's primary-segment call = Lane-B.
- Phase-4 architecture · Phase-5 analytics integrity (`bycodex_Next_Steps.md`).

### Marble arc — the 32-idea opportunity backlog (re-homed 2026-07-15 after the owner asked where it went)

**Why this block exists:** the Marble assessment (s19) produced a ranked 32-idea backlog
(`output/Marble_Audit_2026-07-13/06_NikoLearn_Opportunity_Backlog.md`) whose own verdict is that its top 4
are „worth more than any new game". This roadmap carried **two** Marble lines. The other 30 ideas had no row
anywhere — not NOW, not NEXT, not LATER, not DROPPED. They fell out silently, which rule 2 forbids. Root
cause: this ledger was built from the handoff + the NB tracker, and **both are bug-shaped**, so an
idea-shaped input had no intake path (see the PI ledger in `PRODUCT_IDEAS.md`, created the same day).

The full ranked list stays in the audit file (rule 1: mirrored, never replaced). Status of the TOP TIER:

| # | Idea | P | Honest status |
|---|---|--:|---|
| 1 | Content-validation gate (script fails CI on a broken item) | 12 | **PARTIAL** — `content/graph/validate.mjs` validates the graph JSON only; quiz items are still unvalidated |
| 2 | Observable-evidence authoring standard (2-3 mastery criteria per skill) | 12 | **NOT STARTED.** Effort=1. The cheapest high-value row on this page |
| 3 | AI tutor scope-grounding (owl bounded by a fixed skill list) | 10 | **NOT STARTED** — the graph exists, the tutor does not read it |
| 4 | Math prerequisite DAG as design-time backbone | 10 | In flight as `content/graph/math-fractions.v0.json` (11-node ka ladder, validator green) |
| 5 | „Why this matters" tutor lines from prerequisite reasons | 10 | **HALF** — `edges[].reason_ka` is authored in the data; `tutor.js` never reads it, so the child never hears it |
| 6 | Parent dashboard „რას სწავლობს შენი შვილი ახლა" | 10 | **NOT STARTED** |
| 7 | Unlock-because-you-mastered-X moment | 10 | **NOT STARTED.** Effort=1 |

**PO read (not yet owner-decided):** #2 and #7 are Effort-1 / P≥10 and are the two strongest jump candidates
once the NOW block clears. #5 is the sharpest waste on the page: the expensive half (authoring the Georgian
reasons) is DONE and the child gets zero benefit because nothing reads it. Ideas #8-#32 stay ranked in the
audit file and are re-scored when this block is picked up, not before.

## ▶ DROPPED / ამოვარდნილი (permanent ledger — appended, never pruned)

Every row here was a real candidate that is NOT being done. Kept so that „why isn't this in the plan"
always has an answer, and so a revive trigger can fire later.

| Item | Dropped | Why | Revive trigger | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CX-01 guest→guided-first-win A/B** | 2026-07-12 | Judged an owner product hypothesis, not a defect → deliberately not logged as an NB. Lived only in a handoff sentence until today. | Owner picks the primary segment → becomes Phase-1 activation | Codex audit |
| **Landing tap targets <44px** | 2026-07-12 | Below the MEDIUM logging bar at triage. Not re-verified since. | Any owner/phone report of mis-taps on landing | Codex audit |
| **Perf / type / nav findings** | 2026-07-12 | Codex-plausible, judged below the bar. Never enumerated individually — if we want them we must re-read the audit. | A perf complaint, or Play-Store review prep | Codex audit |
| **Grant funding** | 2026-07-12 | Owner decision: dropped, **never re-surface**. | None. Do not raise. | Owner |
| **NB-31 CSP + innerHTML hardening** | 2026-07-15 | Real, but heavy: needs an innerHTML/inline-handler refactor across the app. Current risk genuinely low (repo private, names sanitized, no external links). Cost >> today's risk. | Any user-generated content beyond names, OR a backend, OR Play submission hardening | Codex CP-01 |
| **NB-7 telemetry allow-list · NB-11 stale EN regexes · NB-12 listening-mode text fallback** | earlier | DEFER: CF-Worker coupling (NB-7); low value, ka-first (NB-11); NB-12 real but no report yet. | NB-12 revives on any audio-fails report | 07-02 audit / s9 |
| **Features 9-10 of the 2026-07-18 10-feature list** (9 = progress export/print, 10 = diaspora mode) | 2026-07-18 | Owner verdict on the list: „9-10 დროებით არა" — temporary no, not a rejection. | Owner revisits after the W1-W8 wave ships | Owner (GI-34) |
| **NB-37(B) ~120 kings-math EN translation** | 2026-07-14 | A multi-session authoring project of questionable value, in tension with „the app teaches English through content, chrome stays Georgian". Default = keep ka. | Owner picks Option B explicitly | s19 fork |
| **Theme picker option B (bold full re-skin)** | 2026-07-14 | Chrome-only shipped instead; subject/world hues kept as fixed identity the owner likes. | Owner asks for a bolder re-skin | NB-48 |
| **LLM-in-CI genuine auto-fix tier** | 2026-07-14 | Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + spend approval = owner money gate. Deterministic version-sync tier shipped instead. | Owner approves spend | NB-46 |
| **UAOP external-agent onboarding protocol** | 2026-07-12 | Owner pivot: „no more governance/doc expansion — maximize PRODUCT progress". Premise verified true (no AGENTS.md; Codex/Antigravity don't load the Constitution). | Owner ask only | s18 |
| **30-day NOT-list:** games.js refactor · CSP/a11y · i18n backfill · C&A · fractions · v2 polish · governance docs · MagicSchool | 2026-07-12 | Explicitly excluded to protect the 30-day critical path (distribution → child observation → Play → retention read). | 08-08 retention readout re-opens the list | 30-day plan |
| **Marble runtime graph-routing** | 2026-07-13 | Deferred BY DESIGN (learning #3): design-time backbone first; the adaptive engine (`placement.js`) already exists, so the graph is a data upgrade not a new system. | Backbone lands + Math content fills | Marble arc |
| **NB-34 profile-null-crash-guard branch** (`da77e6f`) | carried | Built, never pushed. Not dropped on merit — it simply lost its turn. | Next live push train | s16 |
| **NB-35 PWA-telemetry client build** | carried | Root-caused, fix planned; the worker part rides the NB-26/27 deploy gate. | NB-26/27 worker deploy | s18 |
